There are two parts to our code: one in an iPython file that includes all of
the code for creating and testing Blokus, and one in a Python file that is used
to play the game with user input from the terminal.

iPython file:
- Navigate to the proper directory on your computer where our iPython file
is located.
- Type "ipython notebook", without quotes, into the terminal line.
- Your browser should automatically open the directory with the iPython file in
a separate window.
- Click on the iPython file; it should be named "Blokus Solver"

Python file:
- In order to view the code itself, feel free to open in your text editor of
choice.
- In order to play the game, navigate to the appropriate directory from terminal.
- Type "Play_Blokus.py" into the terminal.
- Instructions should appear and you can begin to play the game of Blokus against
an algorithm of your choice!
